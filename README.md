# Regarding the EGU convener guidelines and rules

Dear *EGU*,

The convener guidelines and rules state "(Co-)conveners cannot be the presenting author, and are discouraged from being a co-author, in oral presentations in a session they convene" ([https://www.egu24.eu/guidelines/conveners.html](https://www.egu24.eu/guidelines/conveners.html).

A different set of rules was posted on the website during the session abstract submission period, which did not contain this rule. See this snapshot of the website from Sep 23 2023:

We, early-career scientist (ECS) conveners and co-conveners of sessions in the seismology section, including co-organised sessions, for the upcoming EGU 2024, therefore made the decision to convene before we were aware of this rule. This puts us in a difficult position, where we have committed to help convening the sessions but instead may prefer to give oral presentations in them. Apart from the unexpected change in rules, we also have fundamental concerns about the rule itself.

We as ECS take part in convenership to gain visibility in the community, expand our professional networks, and also as a service to the community by hosting high-quality sessions at EGU to enable other researchers to present their work. At the same time, we expect to be able to present our scientific work unfettered, which this rule disallows. Especially at early career stages, oral presentations are crucial to reach a broad audience.

We are likely to convene a session in a field that our research is focused on and thus we are also likely to want to present in our own sessions and be affected by this rule disproportionately. The negative impact this rule has on our career development affects the future of EGU negatively, as well. In the appendix, we list explicit reasons for this.

In an anonymous survey among the ECS conveners in the seismology section we found that 69% (out of 39 replies) indicate they are less likely to convene a session in the future or have already decided to not convene a session again due to this rule.

We kindly ask EGU to reconsider their stance on this rule. As an immediate measure, we hope EGU will follow the first set of rules posted until the session proposal deadline. In the long term, we hope that EGU will exclude ECS from the rule, or remove it altogether.

Respectfully,

Sven Schippkus (convener session SM5.2)
Charlotte Bruland (convener session SM5.3)

Appendix
	 	 	 	
Oral presentations at EGU tend to reach a different, larger audience than poster presentations. Therefore, removing the option for ECS to give oral presentations in the sessions they convene, will reduce visibility for their own research in their research community.
This rule can negatively affect the career development of ECS due to:
Lower number of citations
Fewer opportunities to establish collaborations
Less visibility for future or ongoing job applications
Less opportunity to convince potential reviewers for publications or proposals

This rule can negatively affect EGU due to:
ECS perceive this rule as lack of appreciation for invested time and effort
ECS may decide not convene a session again
ECS may discourage others from convening sessions
ECS may be discouraged from convening a session multiple years in a row, which would result in lower quality sessions organized by conveners with less experience
Fewer interested and committed conveners in coming years, particularly among ECS
Fewer qualified and motivated candidates for other positions within EGU in the future
